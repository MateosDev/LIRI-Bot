<!-- Organization -->

## Organization

Requires are located at the top of the liri.js file along with an instanciated spotify and user input global variable.

All functions are called through a switch case wrapped into a function for logging. Each of the four commands used in this app have their own functions.

`concert-this`

`spotify-this-song`

`movie-this`

`do-what-it-says`

The functions themselves are created in the bottom half of the liri.js file.

#### `do-what-it-says`

LIRI will take the text inside of random.txt and then use it to call one of LIRI's commands.

- It should run `movie-this` for `Pulp Fiction` as follows the random text in `random.txt` file.
- Edit the text in random.txt to test out the feature for `movie-this`, `spotify-this-song` and `concert-this`.
